The .java classes related to the two following scenarios are located in the following directory as noted in the assignment specifications:

Group21\src\main\java\model\

Due to being together in the same directory, there are two different Main.java files for each scenario named MainEnquiry.java and MainRegister.java respectively.

There are print statements that will show the status of the sequence execution after running one of the Main.java files.

Some instances where complicated functionalities are not implemented such as validating a payment so a dummy return is utilised but shows it can be done.
